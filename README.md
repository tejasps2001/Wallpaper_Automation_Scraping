# Wallpaper_Automation_Scraping

This script scrapes [Wallhaven](wallhaven.cc) using Selenium to download a bunch of wallpapers for the user to select.

The batch file runs the script.

This is an inefficient version of [Wallpaper_Automation](https://github.com/tejasps2001/Wallpaper_Automation) and only works on Windows.

This script saves the wallpapers on a Temp folder in the user's Pictures directory.

Firefox must be installed for this script to work.
